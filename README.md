### RunicOS
#### Roxy's Undeniably Naive Implementation (of) Concepts (in) OS

RunicOS is a personal project that aims to implement many OS concepts
from the ground up - starting from a bootloader and building up to,
well... whatever comes of it!

RunicOS is implemented using NASM and C, with a target architecture of x86_64.

Dependencies:

- ```qemu-img``` and ```qemu-system-x86_64```
- GNU binutils and coreutils
